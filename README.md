## About

This repository is created to align the implementation of digital wallets across the EWC LSP consortium wallet providers. This also ensures all wallets providers can self-test and sign off against the EWC Interoperability Test Bed (ITB). 

## Contributing

Feel free to improve the plugin and send us a pull request. If you find any problems, please create an issue in this repo. Wallet providers can raise a PR once they have implemented and aligned with the RFCs.
